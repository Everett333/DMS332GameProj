# Climber's Dilemma

## A transformative platformer where a determined climber traverses from earthly depths to the stars.

## This 3d platformer is an open experience to casual gamers who have interest in learning the intricacies of difficult games. The progression throughout the game allows for a streamlined experience for those who are new to games and those who are looking for a challenge.

The game itself focuses on enviornments consisting of surreal, even liminal spaces. It will rely heavily on level design and prior knowledge to provide the player with information, allowing the player to figure out what their goal is and what tools they have at their disposal through context. By doing so, the game's unqiueness comes in its visualization of solitude, and having the player embrace the solace that comes in the world they travel in alone.


[SUBJECT TO CHANGE]
As of now, the game's flowstate from start to end follows:

The player starts with an enormous moutain in view, and level design implies there is nowhere else to go but up the mountain. As they traverse up the mountain they learn of the obstacles that cloud the path. Items that boost the player and allow them to continue their path up the mountain appear along the way, and by interacting with them and learning how to use them through experimentation instructions write themselves.

From the point when they reach the top of the mountain they are transported to the clouds, a similar but shorter level where the player learns to travel across the path in front of them further up into the horizon.

And with that the player gets transported to the final level, where they reach space. they will follow a linearly designed path that leads them across asteroids and planets to the ends of the universe.
